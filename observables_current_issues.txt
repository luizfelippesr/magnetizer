#Minor issues to be fixed. Working on them currently

1) ./Observables.exe 'example/example_global_parameters.in' 'synchrotron' 0.0  produces all intensities zero

2) ./Observables_single.exe "I" example/example_global_parameters.in 10 12 0.7 0.002 0 0 produces output. 
But ./Observables_single.exe "I" example/example_global_parameters.in 13 12 0.7 0.002 0 0 gives interpolation error. Seems like igal=13, iz=10 is an unfinished galaxy. But somehow the program not excluding this galaxy. 

3)Check conversion of arbitrary units to Physical units

4)check if los integral can done via some adaptive step size method. This will speed up the code

5) Modify convergence criteria for total and polarized intensities


5)In certain cases there is up to 10 % difference between synchrotron intensities calculated using volume and LoS method
